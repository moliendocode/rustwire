## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/moliendocode/rustwire/issues).
  
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/moliendocode/rustwire/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a detailed description of your enhancement. 
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
  
### Pull Requests

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Style Guidelines

Please ensure you adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Code**: Ensure you follow standard Rust formatting guidelines. We recommend using `rustfmt` before submitting a pull request.
  
- **Commits**: Use clear and meaningful commit messages.
